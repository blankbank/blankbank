- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blankbank
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in dota 2
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for help in understanding codes
and also I wanna learn how to secure my data.
- I have missing items on my inventory and apparently
steamsv.exe detected a stack-based buff that can control 
my data. I don't even what that is, and when I check my personal
game data;

*Category - Items
*Sub-category - Transaction 

Time initiated and time last updated are the recent days , I'm 
losing and/or someone's been stealing my dota 2 items. Fucking
bitch stole worth around 2.5k-3k CAD. Please help me.
